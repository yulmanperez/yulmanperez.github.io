My work has been centered on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery and long-term energy and waste storage. A major focus of my PhD research was the development and application of multi-scale X-ray CT imaging workflows to quantify heterogeneities within the rock matrix, providing insights that are critical to understand the mass-transfer processes.

During my PhD journey, I have engaged in a diverse set of projects that have expanded my technical expertise and broadened my perspective on the energy industry, including:

1. Deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico
- Segment: Offshore Oil & Gas
Focuses on the extraction and production of oil and gas from deepwater fields, which involves exploration, drilling operations, and infrastructure development in offshore environments.
2. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) site assessments in Alberta, Canada
- Segment: Carbon Management / Environmental Sustainability
Involves identifying suitable locations and conducting feasibility studies for capturing COâ‚‚ emissions and storing them underground, a critical part of addressing climate change within the energy sector.
3. Geospatial analysis of electricity curtailment in California
- Segment: Renewable Energy / Grid Management
Addresses issues related to the overproduction of renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar) and its curtailment due to grid limitations, providing insights into energy storage, grid optimization, and renewable integration.
4. Subsurface evaluations of gas field infrastructure in California, spanning active, abandoned, and underground gas storage sites
- Segment: Natural Gas / Infrastructure & Storage
Focuses on understanding the status, risks, and operations of active and inactive natural gas fields and storage sites, which is crucial for energy security, regulation, and safety.
5. Core characterization of the Wolfcamp Formation at the HFTS-1 test site in the Permian Basin
- Segment: Unconventional Oil & Gas (Shale)
Involves detailed geological analysis and characterization of the Wolfcamp Shale, an important source of oil and gas in the Permian Basin, focusing on reservoir quality, resource extraction potential, and subsurface behavior.
6. Training and testing generative computer vision models using X-ray CT imaging
- Segment: Energy Technology / Data Science & AI
Focuses on using AI and machine learning techniques to analyze imaging data for enhanced decision-making, particularly in reservoir management, drilling, and equipment maintenance.
7. Energy market internship with the Autobidder team
- Segment: Energy Markets / Energy Trading & AI
Focuses on energy market operations, particularly around optimizing electricity generation and distribution using AI-driven bidding and trading algorithms, with a focus on grid management and price forecasting.

As I transition from academia into industry, my immediate goal is to apply this expertise within a major energy company, while leaving space to pursue future endeavors that connect technical innovation with the dynamics of global energy markets.
