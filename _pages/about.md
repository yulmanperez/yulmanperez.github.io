My work has been centered on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery and long-term energy and waste storage. A major focus of my PhD research was the development and application of multi-scale X-ray CT imaging workflows to quantify heterogeneities within the rock matrix, providing insights that are critical to understand the mass-transfer processes.

During my PhD journey, I have engaged in a diverse set of projects that have expanded my technical expertise and broadened my perspective on energy systems:

- Offshore deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico.
- Carbon capture and storage (CCS) site assessment in Alberta, Canada.
- Geospatial analysis of electricity curtailment in California.
- Subsurface evaluation of gas field infrastructure in California, including active, abandoned, and underground gas storage sites.
- Core characterization of the Wolfcamp Formation at the HFTS-1 test site in the Permian Basin.
- Training and testing of generative computer vision models with X-ray CT images.
- Energy markets internship with the Autobidder team.

The previous experiences have equipped me to contribute to the development of sustainable subsurface solutions for the future of energy. As I transition from academia into industry, my immediate goal is to apply this expertise within a major energy company, while leaving space to pursue future endeavors that connect technical innovation with the dynamics of global energy markets.
