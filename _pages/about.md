My work has been centered on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery and long-term energy and waste storage. A major focus of my PhD research was the development and application of multi-scale X-ray CT imaging workflows to quantify heterogeneities within the rock matrix, providing insights that are critical to understand the mass-transfer processes.

During my PhD journey, I have engaged in a diverse set of projects that have expanded my technical expertise and broadened my perspective on the energy industry, including:

1. Deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico
- Segment: Offshore Oil & Gas

2. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) site assessments in Alberta, Canada
- Segment: Carbon Management / Environmental Sustainability

3. Geospatial analysis of electricity curtailment in California
- Segment: Renewable Energy / Grid Management

4. Subsurface evaluations of gas field infrastructure in California, spanning active, abandoned, and underground gas storage sites
- Segment: Natural Gas / Infrastructure & Storage

5. Core characterization of the Wolfcamp Formation at the HFTS-1 test site in the Permian Basin
- Segment: Unconventional Oil & Gas (Shale)

6. Training and testing generative computer vision models using X-ray CT imaging
- Segment: Energy Technology / Data Science & AI

7. Energy market internship with the Autobidder team
- Segment: Energy Markets / Energy Trading & AI

As I transition from academia into industry, my immediate goal is to apply this expertise within a major energy company, while leaving space to pursue future endeavors that connect technical innovation with the dynamics of global energy markets.

News
======
1. A new study on the mass transfer mechanims of Unconventional Formations (Shale) will be released soon.
   
2. The study: Where is curtailed electricity happening in California? Opportunities for energy storage  will be presented at the 2025 SPE WRM.
