My current research area focused on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery or energy/waste storage. One of my key responsibilities includes the acquisition of X-ray CT images at different length scales to quantify major heterogeneities within the rock matrix. 

During my PhD journey, I have been exposed to a unique set of projects that have helped me to build my skills, including  

- Deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico.  
- Carbon capture and storage, CCS in Alberta. 
- Geospatial analysis of electricity curtailment in California.
- Spatial analysis of gas field distribution and infrastructure in California.
- Characterization of unconventional resources in the Wolfcamp Formation at the HFTS-1 test site in the Permian Basin, West Texas, USA.
- Training and testing of Generative Computer Vision models with X-ray CT images.

1. A new study on the mass transfer mechanims of Unconventional Formations (Shale) will be released soon.
   
2. The study: Where is curtailed electricity happening in California? Opportunities for energy storage  will be presented at the 2025 SPE WRM.
