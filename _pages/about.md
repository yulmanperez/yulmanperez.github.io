My current research area focused on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery or energy/waste storage. One of my key responsibilities includes the acquisition of X-ray CT images at different length scales to quantify major heterogeneities within the rock matrix. 

During my PhD journey, I have been exposed to a unique set of projects that have helped me to build my skills including Deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Carbon Capture and Storage in Alberta, geospatial Electricity Curtailment / Energy Storage in California, characterization of Unconventional Resources in the WolfCamp Midland Permian formation, and training and testing of Generative Computer Vision models with X-ray CT images.

News
======
1. A new study on the mass transfer mechanims of Unconventional Formations (Shale) will be released soon.
   
2. The study: Where is Curtailed Electricity in California? Opportunities for Energy Storage  will be presented at the 2025 SPE WRM.
