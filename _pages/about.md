Welcome — I’m an engineer advancing technologies for the future of energy.

My PhD research focused on developing multi-scale X-ray CT imaging workflows to better understand rock heterogeneity and mass-transfer processes. Along the way, I’ve applied these skills across the energy industry through projects in areas such as:

- Offshore Oil & Gas: Deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico with Shell.
- Carbon Management: CCS site assessments in Alberta, Canada.
- Renewable Energy: Geospatial analysis of electricity curtailment in California.
- Natural Gas Infrastructure: Evaluations of active, abandoned, and underground storage sites in California.
- Unconventional Oil & Gas: Core characterization of the Wolfcamp Formation at the HFTS-1 test site.
- Energy Technology & AI: Training generative computer vision models on X-ray CT data.
- Energy Markets & Trading: Internship with Tesla’s Autobidder team.

As I transition from academia into industry, I’m eager to apply this expertise within a major energy company while continuing to connect technical innovation with the evolving dynamics of global energy markets.
