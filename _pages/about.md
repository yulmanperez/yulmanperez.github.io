My research centers on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery and long-term energy/waste storage. A key focus of my work is the development and application of multi-scale X-ray CT imaging workflows to quantify heterogeneities within the rock matrix, providing insights that are critical for modeling mass-transfer processes.

During my PhD journey, I have engaged in a diverse set of projects that have expanded my technical expertise and broadened my perspective on energy systems, including:

- Deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico.  
- Carbon capture and storage, CCS in Alberta, Canada. 
- Geospatial analysis of electricity curtailment in California.
- Subsurface study of the gas fields in California, including active, abandoned and undeground gas storage sites.
- Characterization of Wolfcamp Formation core samples collected at the HFTS-1 test site in the Permian Basin.
- Training and testing of Generative Computer Vision models with X-ray CT images.
- Energy markets internship at Autobidder Team.

The previous experiences are building toward my goal of developing sustainable subsurface solutions for the future of energy. In the near term, I aim to gain experience at a major energy company, while leaving space to pursue future endeavors that connect technical innovation with the dynamics of global energy markets.
