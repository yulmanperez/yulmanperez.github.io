My work has centered on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery and long-term energy and waste storage. A major focus of my PhD research was the development and application of multi-scale X-ray CT imaging workflows to quantify heterogeneities within the rock matrix, providing insights that are critical for modeling mass-transfer processes.

Along the way, I have gained a diverse set of experiences that broadened my technical expertise and perspective on energy systems, including:

- Deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico.  
- Carbon capture and storage, CCS in Alberta, Canada. 
- Geospatial analysis of electricity curtailment in California.
- Subsurface study of the gas fields infrastructure in California, including active, abandoned and undeground gas storage sites.
- Characterization of Wolfcamp Formation core samples collected at the HFTS-1 test site in the Permian Basin.
- Training and testing of Generative Computer Vision models with X-ray CT images.
- Energy markets internship at Autobidder Team.

The previous experiences have equipped me to contribute to the development of sustainable subsurface solutions for the future of energy. As I transition from academia into industry, my immediate goal is to apply this expertise within a major energy company, while leaving space to pursue future endeavors that connect technical innovation with the dynamics of global energy markets.
