My current research area is focused on subsurface characterization for hydrocarbon recovery or energy/waste storage. One of my research duties include acquisition of X-ray CT images at different length scales to quantify major heterogeneities within the rock matrix. 

During my PhD journey, I have been exposed to an unique set of projects that have helped me to build my skills including Deepwater operations in the Golf of Mexico, Carbon Capture and Storage in Alberta, geospatiall Electricity Curtailment / Energy Storage in California, Unconventional Resources in the WolfCamp Midland Permian formation. 

News
